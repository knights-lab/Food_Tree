Gastro Meeting with Serina, Abby, Austin
2/14/17

- there is a "food code" associated with every USDA food, which breaks down the food into higher order categories of food, all the way down to the specific type of food (get PDF from Abby)
- there is also a "portion code" which tells you what the serving measurement size used was
- can we generate a "tree" based on the relationships between the food codes?

- consider generating an input file that looks like what Abby's ASA24 looks like:
Food Code, Portion Code, Amt Eaten, etc

NEXT STEPS 
1. standardize input files (PJ/Abby)
2. look into getting food codes + portion codes out of USDA supertracker (austin)
    - look into API - query the entire database?
3. see if we can build a tree based on food codes 

4. add austin to slack - for a project
5. serina's heatmap - add hclustering to food items? (see Wu paper)
6. PCoA of food based on food codes
7. PhyloT generates the taxonomy tree from a list of taxonomy which goes directly into iTOL -- + annotation file (metadata file)
8. support longitudinal data ?
